    "Variational quantum algorithms are a broad set of methods which involve optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit ansatz applied to some initial state (called the \"reference\") in order to minimize a cost function defined with respect to the output state. In the context of quantum simulation, very often the goal is to prepare ground states and the cost function is the expectation value of a Hamiltonian. Thus, if we define the reference (initial state) as $\\lvert \\psi\\rangle$, the Hamiltonian as $H$ and the parameterized quantum circuit as $U(\\vec{\\theta})$ where $\\vec{\\theta}$ are the varaitional parameters, then the goal is to minimize the cost function\n",

    "$$\n",
    "A classical optimization algorithm can be used to find the $\\vec{\\theta}$ that minimizes the value of the expression. The performance of a variational algorithm depends crucially on the choice of ansatz circuit $U(\\vec{\\theta})$, the choice of reference, and the strategy for choosing the initial parameters $\\vec{\\theta}$ since typically global optimizing is challenging and one needs to begin reasonably close to the intended state. One possibility is to use an ansatz of the form\n",
    "$$\n",
    "U(\\vec{\\theta}) = \\prod_j \\exp(-i \\theta_j H_j)\n",
    "$$\n",

OpenFermion-Cirq contains routines for constructing ansatzes of this form which use as templates the Trotter step algorithms implemented in the `trotter` module."

A VariationalAnsatz is essentially a parameterized circuit that one constructs so that parameters can be supplied symbolically.

We also instantiated a HamiltonianObjective which represents the objective function being the expectation value of our Hamiltonian.\n",

By default, it evaluates parameters by simulating the quantum circuit and computing the objective function, in this case the expectation value of the Hamiltonian, on the final state. It includes an optional state preparation circuit to be applied prior to the ansatz circuit. For this example, we will prepare the initial state as an eigenstate of the one-body operator of the Hamiltonian. Since the one-body operator is a quadratic Hamiltonian, its eigenstates can be prepared using the `prepare_gaussian_state` method. The SwapNetworkTrotterAnsatz class also includes a default setting of parameters which is inspired by the idea of state preparation by adiabatic evolution from the mean-field state."

    "The above example shows one of the nice built-in ansatz offered in OpenFermion-Cirq that can be applied to many different types of physical systems without the need for much input by the user.  In some research cases, however, one may wish to design their own paramterized ansatz.  Here will give an example of how to do this for the simple case of the H$_2$ molecule in a minimal basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide some brief background, in a minimal basis H$_2$ is discretized into two slater-type spatial orbitals, each of which is expressed as a sum of 3 Gaussians (STO-3G).  After pre-processing with a mean-field, Hartree-Fock, procedure, the best meanfield approximation of the ground state is found to be the symmetric superposition of these two spatial orbitals.  After including spin in the problem by assigning each spatial orbital an alpha and beta spin, or equivalently the tensor product of the spatial and spin-$1/2$ degree of freedom, the mean-field state is expressed as\n",

    "Within the Jordan-Wigner encoding of fermionic systems, this is equivalent to a computational basis state with the first two qubits being in the 1 state and the second two qubits in the 0 state.  This can be prepared via a simple circuit as\n",

    "\n",
    "As a result of the symmetries present in this system, only one transition is allowed, and it completely characterizes the freedom required to move from this initial guess to the exact ground state solution for all geometries of H$_2$ in the minimal basis.  That is the concerted transitions of electrons from spin-orbitals 0, 1 to 2, 3.  This corresponds to the fermionic operator $a_3^\\dagger a_2^\\dagger a_1 a_0$, which is of course not unitary, but one may lift this operation to the anti-hermitian generator of a rotation as in unitary coupled cluster to yield the unitary\n",

    "\n",
    "which may be decomposed exactly using a combination of the Jordan-Wigner transformation and standard identites from Nielsen and Chuang.  However, as has been noted before, the essential action of concerted electron movement can be captured in only a single of the Jordan-Wigner terms, hence the simpler operation\n",

    "In the following code we first load up one example geometry of the H$_2$ molecule, as this data is included with OpenFermion. To compute such Hamiltonians for arbitrary molecules in different basis sets geometries, etc., one can use plugins such as [OpenFermion-Psi4](https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion-PySCF) or [OpenFermion-PySCF](https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion-PySCF). Later we will use these same techniques to load and evaluate the full curve with our ansatz."
